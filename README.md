# 130nm clock multiplier PLL

An on-chip clock mulitplier PLL designed using open source tools and sky130nm pdk

## Introduction
A clock multiplier Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) is a negative feedback control system that generates a high-frequency output clock whose phase is related to the low frequency input clock. The need for PLLs is widespread as they find application in analog, digital, RF and communication systems. <br>The low-frequency clock can be generated using a crystal with frequencies up to 200 MHz. Generating a high-frequency clock with high spectral purity is not possible with a crystal and this is where PLLs come into play. <br>

A simple PLL consists of a Phase and Frequency Detector (PFD), Charge Pump (CP), Loop Filter (LF), Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) and a frequency divider in the feeback path <br>

This PLL design multiplies clock frequency by 8 times. 

## Significance of a PLL

</p>The processors used in our smartphones have various modules inside serving different purposes. These modules may include CPU, GPU, RAM, WiFi module, Audio module, and so on. 

</p> The interesting thing is that each of these modules may not run at a particular clock frequency. For example, the CPU would need a high clock frequency for performing calculations faster, while the Display module may not.
</p> This is where a Phase-Locked Loop circuit comes into the picture. As shown in Figure above, a PLL is installed at the clock entry point of each above module to produce the desired frequency at which the module would operate.

## Pre layout simulations

 ### 1. Phase frequency detector (PFD)  </p>
 A phase frequency detector or a phase comparator outputs an UP or a DOWN signal depending upon the timed phase difference between the input signal and reference signal. If the input signal leads the reference signal an UP signal is produced whereas if the input lags the reference signal a down signal is produced. </p>
 
  **Circuit of PFD used** </p>
  ![Screenshot 2024-03-19 221328](https://github.com/himansh107/VSDCMOS_labs/assets/75253218/5f4dd1ca-ac32-4786-a97e-554b49c25abf)
  </p>

  - input signal - f_clk_in
  - reference signal - f_vco

  </p>
There is a 1ns difference between the time period of f_vco and f_clk_in. This is done to emulate phase & frequency error.   </p>

  **Expected output** </p>

</p>

In the above simulation result when **f_clk_in** **leads** **f_vco** , **UP** signal is triggered (yellow). While when the **f_clk_in lags f_vco** , **DOWN** signal is triggered. 
These two (up & down) signals are fed into the charge pump which is the next block of our implemented PLL.</p>


 ### 2. Charge Pump and Loop filter  </p>

### Charge Pump </p>
 These UP and DOWN pulses are fed into the input of the charge pump. The charge pump is a combination of switches connected to the power supply. This system acts as a current source/sink which injects/draws current into/from the loop filter, based on the duty cycle of UP/DOWN signal. </p>

  **Circuit of Charge Pump used** </p>
![Screenshot 2024-03-20 004414](https://github.com/himansh107/VSDCMOS_labs/assets/75253218/a6503bb3-ee87-4690-8e91-6ce789e45f74)
</p>
In the above schematic transistors M4 and M3 act as current sources while transistors M18 and M10 are current mirrors. The schematic shown above contains the loop filter. One can see it at the Vctrl output pin. </p>

### Loop filter </p>
This charge pump current is fed into the low pass filter. The low pass filter is a capacitor in series with a resistor. The entire system is connected in shunt with the control loop. The duration of pulses from the charge pump decides the amount of charge injected in the capacitor. </p> 

**Circuit of loop filter used** </p>

<img src ="https://github.com/himansh107/nitjsr_pll_130nm/assets/75253218/dbb0c2a0-bd57-489f-9b6d-69b2edfd0263" width="400"/>

</p>
This charge on the plates of the capacitor generates a voltage, which is then used as the control signal (Vctrl) to the VCO. </p>

**Design considerations of Loop filter**</p>
The loop filter consists of a resistor in series with a capacitor. This combination is in parallel with another capacitor as shown in figure above Capacitor C3 adds an integrator path and introduces a pole. The resistor adds a proportional path and introduces a zero. Thus, the system is stable with the addition of these two paths. Capacitor C5 is used to suppress the Vctrl ripple. However, the addition of an additional capacitor comprises on the stability of the PLL. This is because C5 adds another pole. So, to mitigate this issue the value of C5 is chosen to be very small than C3 (~C5 = 0.2*C3) </p>

**Expected output (CP+LF)** </p>

**Simulated output (CP + LF)** </p>

**Charge pump output for UP signal** </p>
![cp_up](https://github.com/himansh107/nitjsr_pll_130nm/assets/75253218/f8af9b6b-3527-493c-9036-8f0bd2488d93)
</p>

**Charge pump output for DOWN signal** </p>

![cp_down](https://github.com/himansh107/nitjsr_pll_130nm/assets/75253218/8867d62f-db7e-44b9-8661-67b459d0cd79)

### Voltage controlled oscillator  
</p>

The control voltage is fed to a differential ring oscillator VCO. The VCO produces an output which is oscillating in nature. The frequency of these oscillations is a function of control voltage. </p>

**Schematic of VCO** </p>
![vco_full](https://github.com/himansh107/nitjsr_pll_130nm/assets/75253218/dfc0547b-6e6c-40c3-9134-7b91a8fe3fec)

<br>

**Simulated output of VCO** </p>

</p>

We can see that the frequency of oscillations increases with increase in control voltage input to VCO. </p>

### Frequency Divider 
</p>
The frequency divider used in this circuit divides the input frequency by 8 times. </p>
